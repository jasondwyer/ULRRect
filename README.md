# ULRRect
Light-weight classes for programmatically building UIViews

ULRRect is a small library that takes some of the pain out of building `UIView`s programmatically. Views are built as percentages of screen size and are therefore adaptive and will scale proportionately with screen size (i.e. iPhone vs iPad). Helper functions also allow quickly determining which device the user is on, as well as creating adaptive font sizes that scale with the screen size.

The main documentation for ULRRect is located here: http://jasondwyer.github.io/ulrrect
